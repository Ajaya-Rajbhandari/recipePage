### What I learned

This project help me to understand the concept of table, change colors of bullet.

I also learned how to use CSS grid to create a responsive layout.```html

<div class="tTable">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Calories</th>
      <td>277kcal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Carb</th>
      <td>0g</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Protein</th>
      <td>20g</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Fat</th>
      <td>22g</td>
    </tr>

  </table>
</div>
```

```css
.instruct ol li::marker {
  color: var(--Brown-800);
  font-weight: 900;
}
```
